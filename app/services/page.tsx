          Is Your Team Your Biggest Security Risk? We Can Help You Change That.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Many small businesses operate under the constant, nagging worry of cyber threats. Phishing emails, ransomware
          attacks, and data breaches are not just problems for large corporations; they are increasingly targeting
          businesses like yours.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Often, these breaches occur not because of sophisticated technological failures, but due to simple human error
          â€“ a clicked malicious link, a weak password, or an unheeded security warning. The cost of such an incident can
          be devastating, leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and operational chaos.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-12">
          Our Starter Kit directly addresses this critical vulnerability by equipping your employees with the awareness
          and understanding they need to recognize and respond to threats effectively.

        <p className="mb-12">
          This kit is ideal for small business owners, managers, and HR professionals who understand the importance of
          cybersecurity but may lack the dedicated resources or in-house expertise to develop comprehensive awareness
          materials. It's particularly beneficial for businesses in professional services (like legal, accounting, or
          consulting firms), small online retailers, and any organization looking for an affordable and effective way to
          significantly boost their team's cybersecurity knowledge and vigilance.
