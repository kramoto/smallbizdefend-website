              Many small business owners feel the pressure. You might be worried about phishing scams that look
              increasingly convincing, the nightmare of a ransomware attack locking up your critical files, or simply
              the nagging feeling that your customer data isn't as secure as it should be.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Perhaps you lack a dedicated IT team, or the technical jargon feels like another language. These are
              common concerns, and they are valid. The reality is, small businesses are increasingly targeted, precisely
              because they are often perceived as easier targets.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              But being a small business doesn't mean you have to be an easy target. We believe that robust
              cybersecurity shouldn't be a luxury reserved for large corporations. We're here to show you how to build a
              strong defense, step by step.
