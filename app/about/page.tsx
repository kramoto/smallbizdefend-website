              At SmallBizDefend, we believe that robust cybersecurity shouldn't be a luxury reserved for large
              corporations. Every small business deserves protection from cyber threats, regardless of their technical
              expertise or budget constraints.
            </p>

              Our mission is to democratize cybersecurity by translating complex security concepts into simple,
              actionable steps that any business owner can implement and understand.

          <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              SmallBizDefend was founded by an IT Security Consultant with over 15 years of hands-on experience
              protecting businesses from cyber threats. Having worked with companies of all sizes, from startups to
              enterprises, our founder recognized a critical gap in the market.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              While large corporations had dedicated IT teams and unlimited budgets for cybersecurity, small businesses
              were left vulnerable, often becoming easy targets for cybercriminals. This realization sparked the
              creation of SmallBizDefend â€“ a company dedicated exclusively to serving the unique needs of small
              businesses.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Our approach is born from real-world experience, not theoretical knowledge. We've seen what works, what
              doesn't, and most importantly, what small businesses actually need to stay secure.
